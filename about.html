            About Catopia
          </h1>
          <p>
            We place cats in loving, responsible, committed, permanent homes, following a comprehensive adoption process which includes taking considerable care in finding good matches and educating prospective adopters about the responsibilities and costs of bringing a cat into their homes and lives.
            <br>
            <br>
            We also serve as a information resource to our community and all pet owners by providing education and information on responsible pet ownership, including the importance of spaying/neutering, positive behavior training, and good nutrition.
<br>
            <br>
            All cats in our care are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, tested for FIV/FeLV, microchipped, and treated with all appropriate veterinary care from our dedicated private practice veterinarian. Upon arrival to our rescue center, Catopia, our kitties are cared for by our amazing team of volunteers while they wait for their forever homes. We rescue cats in distress without regard to age, breed, or ease of placement.
<br>
            <br>
            We are determined to keep administrative expenses extremely low so that virtually every dollar taken in goes directly to the care of our kitties. Our group remains interested in and committed to the welfare of cats beyond the adoption process. For any reason, our adopted cats are always welcomed back to our rescue if their owners are no longer able to care for them.
<br>
            <br>
            We strive to work with area shelters and other rescue and humane organizations to develop a network of supporters and volunteers in order to create a better world for homeless pets.
<br>
            <br>
            Catopia relies on donations, grants, and the generous time of its volunteers to succeed. We are part of a bigger movement across our nation to end the killing of homeless animals in shelters by the year 2025. With your support, we know we can reach this goal!

        <p class="text-white">
          Volunteers play a critical role in carrying out our mission and fill a need that would otherwise have to be performed by paid staff. Whether cleaning dishes, washing laundry, taking out the garbage, or answering the phones, volunteers help Catopia spend its money where it matters – on the felines.
          <br>
          <br>
          Volunteers also make a substantial impact on the lives of the cats with whom they interact. Our Special Needs cats, for example, whose medical conditions diminish their chances of being adopted, are quite content to live long-term at the sanctuary with so many volunteers to offer them cuddles and warm laps to snuggle in. Others, whose timid personalities make placement in a forever home difficult, blossom under the patient and persistent socializing efforts of our volunteers and become ideal adoption candidates.
